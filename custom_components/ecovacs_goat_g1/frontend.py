"""Auto-register and version the bundled Lovelace card.

The integration ships its dashboard card (``frontend/ecovacs-goat-card.js``) and
serves it over HTTP so users do not have to copy the file into ``/config/www``
or add a Lovelace resource by hand. The card is loaded as a frontend module with
a hash of the card file contents as the ``?v=`` cache-busting token, so the
browser automatically fetches the new card whenever the file actually changes
(and only then) - regardless of whether the integration version was bumped.
