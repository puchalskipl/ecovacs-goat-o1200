# Ecovacs GOAT O1200 for Home Assistant

A mower-only Home Assistant custom integration for ECOVACS GOAT lawn mowers,
**tuned for the GOAT O1200 LiDAR Pro** (O-series): live map with the mowed
track and zone boundaries, cutting height control, battery telemetry, and a
dashboard card with mower controls. The integration domain is
**`ecovacs_goat`**.

It gives you a lawn mower entity, useful sensors, mower settings, and an optional dashboard card with map, start, stop, dock, and cut-direction controls.

## Important

This is an unofficial community project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, certified by, or supported by ECOVACS.

Use it at your own risk. A robotic mower has moving blades and can cause damage or injury if used unsafely. Always keep the mower in sight when testing new commands, and stop using the integration if either Home Assistant or the official ECOVACS app loses reliable control.

## Tested Mowers

Developed and tested with an **ECOVACS GOAT O1200 LiDAR Pro** (firmware
2.13.10). GOAT G1-line mowers are also supported.

No promise is made that it will work with any other mower model. ECOVACS vacuums are not supported.

### Mower families

The integration detects the **mower family** and adapts the protocol dialect it uses:

- **GOAT G1 line** (G1, G1-800 / G-800, G1-2000, G1-1600) — supported. Uses the UWB beacon + `*_V2` map dialect.
- **GOAT O-series** (O800 RTK, O1200, O1200 LiDAR Pro, ...) — supported, validated against a live-mowing O1200 LiDAR Pro capture. These models speak a different dialect: the `clean` command (not `clean_V2`), `getCleanInfo` (not `getCleanInfo_V2`), RTK reference points (`rtkPos`) instead of UWB, and the `getMapState` / `getMapTrack` / `getMI` / `getAreaSet` map commands.

For O-series mowers the integration:

- Detects the model and reports it on the **GOAT model line** diagnostic sensor (with `family`, `map_dialect`, and an `experimental` flag).
- Drives the lawn mower entity, start/pause/resume/stop/dock controls, status, battery, error, and the **live position map** (mower marker + path) from the shared position stream.
- Decodes the **mowed track** (`onMapTrack` compact-LZMA pushes) and paints it on the card, resetting it when a new mowing task starts.
- Decodes **zone boundaries** (`onArI` chain-coded polygons) and draws them as dashed outlines (scale calibration is best-effort; the raw chain code is kept in the live-map attributes).
- Exposes the **cutting height** (`AreaParameters.mowHeightLevel`, level x 10 mm on the O1200) as a number entity, plus battery temperature / current / voltage telemetry sensors from the `onFwBuryPoint-bd_*` stream.
- Keeps the app-style live map session alive automatically while mowing (the `auto_live_map` option, on by default) so all of the above streams without the official app being open.
- Shows the **RTK base station** on the map (from `getRTK`) where the G1 line shows UWB beacons.
- Treats the map id `"0"` reported by O-series position pushes as a placeholder, not a map switch, so live geometry survives map replies.

## Why This Integration Exists

This project is separate from Home Assistant's regular ECOVACS integration. It was created because the regular Ecovacs/Home Assistant path is built around a broader vacuum-oriented command stack, while this project only targets GOAT mowers and uses behavior observed from the official ECOVACS app.

The goal is to keep communication with the mower conservative: use pushed updates where possible, refresh state only when needed, and avoid broad background polling.

## Features

- Start or resume mowing, stop mowing, and return to dock.
- Battery, error, Wi-Fi, current mow, total mow, and consumable sensors.
- Settings for rain delay, animal protection, AI recognition, edge mowing, safer mode, warning switches, cut direction, mowing efficiency, and obstacle avoidance.
- Diagnostic model-line and feature information to help identify G1 variants.
- Optional Lovelace card with a live map and clear mower controls.
- Opt-in debug capture tools for troubleshooting.

## Installation With HACS

Add the repository as a custom repository:

1. In Home Assistant, open **HACS**.
2. Open the three-dot menu and choose **Custom repositories**.
3. Add `https://github.com/puchalskipl/ecovacs-goat-o1200`.
4. Select category **Integration**.
5. Install **Ecovacs GOAT O1200**.
6. Restart Home Assistant.
7. Add the integration from **Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration**.

### Testing pre-release (beta) builds

Experimental builds — for example new model support being validated with a tester — are **automatically published as pre-releases** from the development branch (each push produces an incrementing beta such as `0.2.0b1`, `0.2.0b2`; only the latest beta is kept, and the line auto-advances after each stable release). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#releases--versioning) for the full release flow. To install one in HACS:

1. Open **Ecovacs GOAT O1200** in HACS.
2. Three-dot menu -> **Redownload**.
3. Enable **Show beta versions**.
4. Pick the beta (e.g. `0.2.0b1`) and download, then **restart Home Assistant**.

To return to a stable build later, redownload and pick the latest non-beta version.

## Setup

You need your ECOVACS account username, password, and country. The integration uses the ECOVACS cloud, just like the official app.

During setup, choose a Home Assistant device name. A generated default such as `Ecovacs-GOAT-1` is provided.

ECOVACS now requires a one-time **email device verification** for Home Assistant. After you submit your account details, check the email inbox for that ECOVACS account, enter the code, and keep using the same Home Assistant instance. The integration stores a stable client device id and keeps the verified account session in a **private Home Assistant store** (not in the config entry). Later startups reuse and rotate that session with `checkLogin`, so they do not password-login again. If the integration later asks you to reauthenticate, confirm the password and enter a fresh email code. You can also start that login yourself from **Settings → Devices & services → Ecovacs GOAT O1200 → Configure → Re-authenticate account**.

## Optional Dashboard Card

The custom card is optional, but recommended. It exposes a clear stop button and a mower-focused map layout.

**No manual install is needed.** The integration bundles the card and registers it with Home Assistant automatically: it serves `ecovacs-goat-card.js` from the integration and loads it as a frontend module, versioned to the integration release so browsers pick up updates after each upgrade (a hard refresh may be needed once).

Just add **Ecovacs GOAT Card** from the custom card picker (you may need to reload the dashboard once after first install).

> **Upgrading from a manual install (do this):** if you previously added a `/local/ecovacs_goat/ecovacs-goat-card.js` Lovelace resource, **remove it** in **Settings -> Dashboards -> Resources**, then hard-refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R). This is required: a dashboard card can only be registered once, and the old manual resource has no version in its URL, so your browser keeps loading the **cached old card** and never picks up the bundled one. You can also delete the copied `config/www/ecovacs_goat/ecovacs-goat-card.js` file.

The card’s **keepalive** control starts a timed **`request_live_position_stream`** session so the mower behaves as if the official app map is open (MQTT-heavy updates). How that fits with the trace outline and the 60 second fallback is explained under **How It Behaves** below.

Example YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:ecovacs-goat-card
entity: lawn_mower.mower
battery_entity: sensor.mower_battery_level
error_entity: sensor.mower_error
area_entity: sensor.mower_mowing_area
progress_entity: sensor.mower_mowing_progress
direction_entity: number.mower_cut_direction
stop_button: button.mower_end_mowing
map_entity: sensor.mower_live_map
name: Mower
```

The card falls back to `sensor.mower_live_map` when `map_entity` is not set, so
set it explicitly if your mower's entities use a different prefix — otherwise
the map shows "Waiting for live map data" forever. `trail_gap_limit`
(map units, default `500`) controls when the live trail is split instead of
drawing a straight line between distant points; set `0` to disable splitting.

## How It Behaves

The integration tries to be conservative with the mower and cloud connection:

- It prefers live updates pushed by ECOVACS over MQTT.
- It refreshes grouped state at startup and after meaningful MQTT changes (with a short debounced readback).
- It avoids broad background polling loops.

### Live map: position line, completed outline, and keepalive

The map is built from two layers that update at different rates:

1. **Completed mowing outline (trace)** — A path from the mower cloud (`getMapTrace_V2`) or from MQTT `onMapTrace_V2`. It shows where the mower has already cut. Trace payloads are relatively heavy, so the integration **throttles** them: **MQTT trace pushes are ignored until enough heading change has accumulated from live position updates** (about **90°** in total, using the mower’s reported heading and/or the direction of travel between consecutive points, with a small minimum move distance so noise does not open the gate). When that threshold is reached, the integration schedules a trace refresh and accepts new trace data. **If `onPos` never arrives**, that heading gate never advances from turns alone, so while **mowing** the integration also **refreshes the trace on the same slow cloud poll** it uses for position when MQTT has gone stale (about **every 60 seconds**).

2. **The “last line” / in-progress segment** — While **mowing**, the integration keeps a short polyline of recent **positions** (`position_history`): ideally one point per MQTT **`onPos`** message. If **`onPos` has been quiet for about 60 seconds**, a background task asks the cloud for **`getPos`** instead. When a new trace snapshot is applied, that live segment is **reset** so the stored outline and the line still being drawn stay aligned.

**Keepalive (“someone is watching the map”)** — In the official app, opening the live map nudges the cloud and mower toward **faster `onPos`** and related map traffic. Home Assistant does not do that continuously. The service **`ecovacs_goat.request_live_position_stream`** asks ECOVACS for an **app-style map session** (map set, trace, map point) and, when you pass **`duration_seconds`**, keeps a **keepalive window** open: a background loop sends **`appping`**, repeats the stream request, and keeps **app-presence MQTT** active so the mower treats the session like an open app map. The optional **Ecovacs GOAT** card starts this for you (default **10 minutes** per activation) and passes **`force: true`**, which bypasses the coordinator’s usual spacing on stream requests so the loop can stay aggressive while the window runs. **While MQTT `onPos` is flowing**, the moving dot and the live segment update from those pushes, and accumulated heading opens the **trace** gate after turns. If **`onPos` stops** (no keepalive and no mower pushes), updates fall back to the **~60 second** mowing poll for both position and trace, which keeps the map roughly current but not smoothly animated.

Constants such as the 90Â° gate, 60 second stale interval, and stream request spacing live in `mower_coordinator.py` if you need exact values.

## Debug Capture

If a model or feature does not work, use the debug capture services before opening an issue. Captures are disabled by default and stored locally under `/config/ecovacs_goat_debug/`.

Recommended workflow:

1. Call `ecovacs_goat.start_debug_capture` from **Developer Tools -> Services**.
2. Reproduce the problem.
3. Optionally call `ecovacs_goat.mark_debug_capture` at useful moments.
4. Call `ecovacs_goat.stop_debug_capture`.
5. Download Home Assistant diagnostics or call `ecovacs_goat.export_debug_capture`.

Do not share passwords, access tokens, device IDs, or private network details publicly.

## Troubleshooting

- If entities are unknown after setup, press **Refresh state** once the mower is online.
- If commands fail, check whether the official ECOVACS app can still control the mower.
- If both Home Assistant and the official app lose contact with the mower, stop testing and recover the mower first.
- When opening an issue, include the integration version, mower model, Home Assistant logs, and the action that failed.

## Safety

Only use mower commands when the mower is in a safe outdoor state. Keep people, pets, and objects away from the mower while testing. If behavior looks wrong, stop the mower with the official app or physical controls first.

This software is provided without any warranty. Compatibility is best effort and may change if ECOVACS changes its app, cloud service, firmware, or account behavior. You are responsible for deciding whether it is safe to use with your mower and property.
